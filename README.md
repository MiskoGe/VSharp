**an interpreted programming language that allows you to write all types of programs, from simple console applications to even games**


V# is a new and modern programming language. 
characteristics:

- **made in C#**
- **easy to learn**

### installation
 - first you need to **download V#**
 - then **unzip** the file to a location you like
 - the next step is to *run* **install.bat**

at this point you can already use V#

### Requirements 
- **.net 7.0** install.bat will download the installer file for you 
- the file editor can be a regular notepad
- administrator permissions
- Console
### Special thanks
[Thanks](https://github.com/funcieqDEV/VSharp/blob/main/SPECIAL_THANKS.md)
### Compilation
- **Download source**
after you download source you shoud check if<br> you have .net 7.0 and right code editor like Visual studio

- **Create new project in Visual studio**
once you have created a new project you should add files from the **src** folder to your project

- **Edit main.cs/program.cs**
if you want use V# interpreter first you need to create a Lexer class with input(your V# code) as an argument,
<br> then create a Parser class. In the Parser constructor use the Lexer method `Tokenize` as an argument which will return a list of tokens<br> next step is create a Interpreter class and in constructor put Parser method `Parse` it will return ProgramNode, now you can use Interpreter method `Interpret`
